This directory contains testing code for clixon and the example
routing application:
	clixon    A top-level script clones clixon in /tmp and starts all.sh
                  You can _copy_ this file (review it) and place as cron script
        all.sh    Run through all tests named 'test*.sh' in this directory.
	          Therefore, if you place a test in this directory matching 
		  'test*.sh' it will be run automatically. 
        test1.sh  First test
        test2.sh  Second test,...
