- Change internal protocol from clicon_proto.h to netconf.
- Netconf startup configuration support. Set CLICON_USE_STARTUP_CONFIG to 1 to
  enable. Eg, if backend_main is started with -CIr startup will be copied to
  running.
- Added ".." as valid step in xpath
- Use restconf format for internal xmldb keys. Eg /a/b=3,4
- List keys with special characters are RFC 3986 encoded.	
- Changed example to use multiple cli callbacks
- Added cli multiple callback and expand support. Use options 
  CLICON_CLIGEN_CALLBACK_SINGLE_ARG and CLICON_CLIGEN_EXPAND_SINGLE_ARG 
  to control these.
  The multiple support for expand callbacks is enabled but not for callbacks
  since this causes problems for legacy applications.
  If you change to multiple argument callbacks change all cli callback functions.
  Library functions in clixon_cli_api.h (e.g cli_commit) is rewritten in new
  for (eg cli_commitv). See clixon_cli_api.h for new names.
- Added --with-cligen and --with-qdbm configure options
- Added union type check for non-cli (eg xml) input 
- Empty yang type. Relaxed yang types for unions, eg two strings with different length.
	
Dec 2016: Dual license: both GPLv3 and APLv2
	
Feb 2016: Forked new clixon repository from clicon
