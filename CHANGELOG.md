# Clixon CHANGELOG

## Upcoming 3.3.2

### Known issues
* Please use text datastore, key-value datastore no up-to-date
* Restconf RPC does not encode output correct

### Major changes:
* Added support for YANG anyxml. 

* Changed top-level netconf get-config and get to return `<data>` instead of `<data><config>` to comply to the RFC.
  * If you use direct netconf get or get-config calls, you may need to handle the return XML differently.
  * RESTCONF and CLI is not affected.
  * Example: 
```
  Query: 
    <rpc><get/></rpc>  
  New reply: 
    <rpc-reply>
       <data>
          <a/> # Example data model
       </data>
    </rpc-reply>

  Old reply: 
    <rpc-reply>
       <data>
          <config>  # Removed
             <a/>
          </config> # Removed
       </data>
    </rpc-reply>
```

* Added support for yang presence and no-presence containers. Previous default was "presence".
  * Empty containers will be removed unless you have used the "presence" yang declaration.
  * Example YANG without presence: 
```
     container 
        nopresence { 
          leaf j { 
             type string; 
          } 
     }
```
If you submit "nopresence" without a leaf, it will automatically be removed:
```
     <nopresence/> # removed
     <nopresence>  # not removed
        <j>hello</j>
     </nopresence>
```

* Added YANG RPC support for netconf, restconf and CLI. With example rpc documentation and testcase. This replaces the previous "downcall" mechanism.
  * This means you can make netconf/restconf rpc calls
  * However you need to register an RPC backend callback using the backend_rpc_cb_register() function. See documentation and example for more details.
  * Example, the following YANG RPC definition enables you to run a netconf rpc.
```
    YANG:
      rpc myrpc {
         input {
	   leaf name {
	      type string;
           }
         }
      }
    NETCONF:
      <rpc><myrpc><name>hello</name><rpc>
    RESTCONF:
      curl -sS -X POST -d {"input":{"name":"hello"}} http://localhost/restconf/operations/myroute'
```

* Enhanced leafref functionality: 
  * Validation for leafref forward and backward references; 
  * CLI completion for generated cli leafrefs for both absolute and relative paths.
  * Example, relative path:
```
         leaf ifname {
             type leafref {
                 path "../../interface/name";
             }
         }
```
	
* Added state data: Netconf `<get>` operation, new backend plugin callback: "plugin_statedata()" for retreiving state data.
  * You can use netconf: `<rpc><get/></rpc>` and it will return both config and state data.
  * Restconf GET will return state data also, if defined.
  * You need to define state data in a backend callback. See the example and documentation for more details.

### Minor changes:
* Added xpath support for predicate: current(), eg /interface[name=current()/../name]
* Added prefix parsing of xpath, allowing eg /p:x/p:y, but prefix ignored.
* Corrected Yang union CLI generation and type validation. Recursive unions did not work.
* Corrected Yang pattern type escaping problem, ie '\.' did not work properly. This requires update of cligen as well.
* Compliance with RFC: Rename yang xpath to schema_nodeid and syntaxnode to datanode.
* Main yang module (CLICON_YANG_MODULE_MAIN or -y) can be an absolute file name.
* Removed 'margin' parameter of yang_print().
* Extended example with ietf-routing (not only ietf-ip) for rpc operations.
* Added yang dir with ietf-netconf and clixon-config yang specs for internal usage.
* Fixed bug where cli set of leaf-list were doubled, eg cli set foo -> foofoo
* Restricted yang (sub)module file match to match RFC6020 exactly
* Generic map_str2int generic mapping tables
* Removed vector return values from xmldb_get()
* Generalized yang type resolution to all included (sub)modules not just the topmost
	
## 3.3.1 June 7 2017

* Fixed yang leafref cli completion for absolute paths.

* Removed non-standard api_path extension from the internal netconf protocol so that the internal netconf is now fully standard.

* Strings in xmldb_put not properly encoded, eg eth/0 became eth.00000
	
## 3.3.0

May 2017	
	
* Datastore text module is now default.

* Refined netconf "none" semantics in tests and text datastore

* Moved apps/dbctrl to datastore/

* Added connect/disconnect/getopt/setopt and handle to xmldb API

* Added datastore 'text'

* Configure (autoconf) changes
  Removed libcurl dependency
  Disable restconf (and fastcgi) with configure --disable-restconf
  Disable keyvalue datastore (and qdbm) with configure --disable-keyvalue

* Created xmldb plugin api
  Moved qdbm, chunk and  xmldb to datastore keyvalue directories
  Removed all other clixon dependency on chunk code
	
* cli_copy_config added as generic cli command
* cli_show_config added as generic cli command
  Replace all show_confv*() and show_conf*() with cli_show_config()
  Example: replace:
     show_confv_as_json("candidate","/sender");
  with:
     cli_show_config("candidate","json","/sender");
* Alternative yang spec option -y added to all applications
* Many clicon special string functions have been removed
* The netconf support has been extended with lock/unlock
* clicon_rpc_call() has been removed and should be replaced by extending the
  internal netconf protocol. 
  See downcall() function in example/routing_cli.c and 
  routing_downcall() in example/routing_backend.c
* Replace clicon_rpc_xmlput with clicon_rpc_edit_config
* Removed xmldb daemon. All xmldb acceses is made backend daemon. 
  No direct accesses by clients to xmldb API.
  Instead use the rpc calls in clixon_proto_client.[ch]
  In clients (eg cli/netconf) replace xmldb_get() in client code with 
  clicon_rpc_get_config().
  If you use the vector arguments of xmldb_get(), replace as follows:
    xmldb_get(h, db, api_path, &xt, &xvec, &xlen);
  with
    clicon_rpc_get_config(h, dbstr, api_path, &xt);
    xpath_vec(xt, api_path, &xvec, &xlen)

* clicon_rpc_change() is replaced with clicon_rpc_edit_config().
  Note modify argument 5:
     clicon_rpc_change(h, db, op, apipath, "value") 
  to:
     clicon_rpc_edit_config(h, db, op, apipath, `"<config>value</config>"`) 

* xmdlb_put_xkey() and xmldb_put_tree() have been folded into xmldb_put()
  Replace xmldb_put_xkey with xmldb_put as follows:
     xmldb_put_xkey(h, "candidate", cbuf_get(cb), str, OP_REPLACE);
  with
     clicon_xml_parse(&xml, `"<config>%s</config>"`, str);
     xmldb_put(h, "candidate", OP_REPLACE, cbuf_get(cb), xml);
     xml_free(xml);

* Change internal protocol from clicon_proto.h to netconf.
  This means that the internal protocol defined in clixon_proto.[ch] is removed

* Netconf startup configuration support. Set CLICON_USE_STARTUP_CONFIG to 1 to
  enable. Eg, if backend_main is started with -CIr startup will be copied to
  running.

* Added ".." as valid step in xpath

* Use restconf format for internal xmldb keys. Eg /a/b=3,4

* List keys with special characters RFC 3986 encoded.	

* Replaced cli expand functions with single to multiple args
  This change is _not_ backward compatible
  This effects all calls to expand_dbvar() or user-defined
  expand callbacks

* Replaced cli callback functions with single arg to multiple args
  This change is _not_ backward compatible.
  You are affected if you 
  (1) use system callbacks (i.e. in clixon_cli_api.h)
  (2) write your own cli callbacks

  If you use cli callbacks, you need to rewrite cli callbacks from eg:
     `load("Comment") <filename:string>,load_config_file("filename replace");`
  to:
     `load("Comment") <filename:string>,load_config_file("filename", "replace");`

  If you write your own, you need to change the callback signature from;
    int cli_callback(clicon_handle h, cvec *vars, cg_var *arg)
  to:
    int cli_callback(clicon_handle h, cvec *vars, cvec *argv)
  and rewrite the code to handle argv instead of arg.
  These are the system functions affected:
  cli_set, cli_merge, cli_del, cli_debug_backend, cli_set_mode, 
  cli_start_shell, cli_quit, cli_commit, cli_validate, compare_dbs, 
  load_config_file, save_config_file, delete_all, discard_changes, cli_notify,
  show_yang, show_conf_xpath

* Added --with-cligen and --with-qdbm configure options
* Added union type check for non-cli (eg xml) input 
* Empty yang type. Relaxed yang types for unions, eg two strings with different length.
