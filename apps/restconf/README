Work-in-progress restconf server

See draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-13.txt

Example nginx-default file:
server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

	index index.html index.htm;

	# Make site accessible from http://localhost/
	server_name localhost;

	location / {
		root /usr/share/nginx/html;
	
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
		# Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location
		# include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules

	}

	# pass the REST API to FastCGI server 
	location /restconf {
		 root /usr/share/nginx/html/restconf;
		 fastcgi_pass unix:/www-data/fastcgi_api.sock;
		 include fastcgi_params;
	}
}
